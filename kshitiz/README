Updates from data preprocessing:
1. 80% percent of the cases (rows in train.csv) with seizure as expert_consensus have only 3 experts, whereas other conditions 
have higher percentage of cases with >3 experts. (See the figure in last cell of EDA_train.ipynb

2. There are "Nan" values in some of the EEG and spectrogram parquet files. I have added four columns to train.csv corresponding to:
- "eeg_50sec_nan_row_count": number of rows in the 50sec time window (i.e. out of 10000 rows) with Nan
- "eeg_10sec_nan_row_count": number of rows in the middle 10 sec of the 50sec time window (i.e. out of 2000 middle rows) with Nan
- "spectrogram_600sec_nan_row_count": number of rows in the 600sec time window (i.e. out of 300 rows) with Nan
- "spectrogram_10sec_nan_row_count": number of rows in the middle 10 sec of the 600sec time window (i.e. out of 6 middle rows) with Nan

Out of 106800, there are 
- 3542 cases of >=1 rows with Nan in the 50sec EEG time windows 
- 727 cases of >=1 rows with Nan in the middle 10sec of 50sec EEG time windows 
- 7743 cases of >=1 rows with Nan in the 600sec Spectrogram time windows 
- 165 cases of >=1 rows with Nan in the middle 10sec of 600sec Spectrogram time windows 

We will have to decide how to deal with the missing value cases. Possible option:
Discard the cases with Nan in middle 10 sec time window in either EEG or Spectrogram, and 
In the remain cases with Nan in reminder of 50sec or 600sec EEG/spectrogram time windows, use an imputation method if we decide to 
use the whole of 50sec and 600sec EEG/spectrograms.
